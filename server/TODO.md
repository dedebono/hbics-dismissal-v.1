# Photo Upload Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Summary

### What was implemented:
1. **Database Schema**: Added `photo_url` column to students table
2. **File Structure**: Created uploads/students/ directory and .gitignore entry
3. **Student Model**: Updated to handle photo_url field in create/update operations
4. **Routes**: 
   - POST `/api/students/:id/photo` - Upload student photo (admin only)
   - GET `/api/students/photo/:filename` - Serve student photos
   - DELETE `/api/students/:id/photo` - Delete student photo (admin only)
5. **Middleware**: 
   - Multer configuration for image uploads (5MB limit, jpeg/jpg/png/gif only)
   - Error handling for file upload validation
   - Admin authentication protection

### Key Features:
- Uses BACKEND_URL environment variable for photo URLs (defaults to localhost:5000)
- File validation: 5MB max size, image formats only
- Automatic file cleanup on errors
- Photo deletion removes both file and database reference
- File naming: `student_{id}{extension}`

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Photo serving endpoint working (returns 404 for non-existent files)
- ✅ Authentication required for protected endpoints (401 status)
- ✅ Server running successfully on port 5000

### How to Use:

1. **Upload Photo**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/students/{id}/photo
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
   Body: form-data with key "photo" and image file
   ```

2. **View Photo**:
   ```bash
   GET /api/students/photo/{filename}
   ```

3. **Delete Photo**:
   ```bash
   DELETE /api/students/{id}/photo
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
   ```

### Environment Variable:
Set `BACKEND_URL` in your .env file for production:
```
BACKEND_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

The implementation is complete and ready for frontend integration!
