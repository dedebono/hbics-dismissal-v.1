# Task: Make StudentDashboard Publicly Accessible

## Steps to Complete:
1. [ ] Update ProtectedRoute component to allow public access to StudentDashboard
2. [ ] Verify that StudentDashboard is not wrapped in ProtectedRoute in App.js
3. [ ] Test the changes to ensure StudentDashboard is accessible without login

## Current Status:
- StudentDashboard is set as default route in App.js but ProtectedRoute redirects to it when user is not logged in
- Need to modify ProtectedRoute logic to handle public routes differently
